|Service Owner and Provider(s)|Österreich Werbung / Austria Tourism (service owner), Contact: Martin Reichhart; Bundesrechenzentrum (application provider), Contacts: Denis Pregesbauer, Gerhard Embacher-Köhle; EOX (provider of hosting platform & support in front end), Contact: Daniel Santillan|
|Abstract Description|The capability is intended for those responsible in the tourism regions to represent the effects of climate change based on geodata, as well as to supplement tourism-specific, economic and social data in order to support awareness building and a data-supported evaluation of options for action. The capability considers various thematic expansion stages (temperature influence, water management, flood protection, risk of alpine hazards, glaciers) as well as strategic planning for tourism operations (finding focus in the requirements phase of the project).|
|Stakeholder(s)|Tourism managers, Communities|

|Expectations|The provision of appropriate satellite data-supported analyses and risk and forecast models for tourism regions can inform the development of long-term adaptation strategies on a fact-based basis, enable more precise resource planning and control the development of immediate recommendations for action. Detecting the onset of snow melt and for estimating snow depth and water content, which are essential for assessing the feasibility of winter tourism activities, especially regarding the availability of natural snow. This is followed by analyses of the thermal behaviour of glaciers, which can provide information about melting, ice movement and the general condition of glaciers, and provide valuable insights into glacier dynamics and their response to climate change. Such analyses are crucial for the management of water resources and the development of corresponding strategies, as well as for the monitoring and tracking of temperature anomalies in alpine regions for the assessment of alpine hazards (risk of rock falls, rock and landslides or collapse of glacial structures. |
|Input Data|Surface temperatures (LST) from various Earth observation sensors: ECOSTRESS: ISS instrument (70m spatial resolution), Landsat 8/9 TIR (100 m thermal sensor Landsat), ASTER (90 m thermal sensor Terra satellite), Sentinel-3 SLSTR (1 km thermal sensor Sentinel-3), Time series of meteorological data (Geosphere): Indicators for demographic, economic, tourism and infrastructural development (Statistik Austria), INCA: Analysis and nowcasting weather data - air temperature, humidity, global radiation and wind speed (hourly resolution, 1 km grid, GeoSphere), Copernicus Land Monitoring Service: high-resolution land cover data, Water and Moisture Index: Presence and extent of water and moisture, Tree Cover Density: Density of tree cover per grid cell from 0 to 100 percent; Degree of sealing: Degree of sealing per grid cell from 0 to 100 percent (GeoVille); Digital elevation model (DEM): Terrain reliefs with precise elevation data and parameters derived from them; Sentinel-2: B02, B03, B04 and B08, including calculation of the NDVI index from the B04 and B08; LULUCF: Land cover and land use typing (10 m resolution, activity for 2023, GeoVille);|
|Pre-processing|When implementing the preprocessing and feeding of input data, OpenEO services [openEO, n.y.] are used.|
|Run-time|The algorithms are packaged in containers and made available for installation in the IT infrastructure. The GTIF capabilities can be demonstrated systematically in a demonstration-like manner via a limited test area via API calls.|
|Output Information Product|TBD|
|GTIF legacy|Snow maps in GTIF-AT Demonstrator|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Comprehensive interactive tool (dashboard/cockpit) for analysing and visualizing the impacts of climate change on tourism planning.|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|Explorer Tourism becomes a helpful tool for various stakeholders: Tourism management: adjustments to tourism offerings and infrastructure (economic/ecological sustainability); Raising awareness: understanding the impacts of climate change and increasing engagement; Informed decision making: informed decisions based on historical, current and future information; Risk management: rapid response to climatic changes, extreme weather events and natural disasters; Research & Development: Pattern and trend recognition, new insights into climate change impacts; Economic benefits: sustainable business planning, investment strategy and product development; Transparency & Collaboration: Transparency and collaboration between different stakeholders (governments, NGOs, science and the private sector), developing common strategies and solutions to address climate change.|
|Deviations/ Reservations|None|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
