|Abstract Description|Value-added service for the provision of detailed, up-to-date Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and Land- Surface Temperature (LST) data and associated analytical capabilities.|
|Stakeholder(s)|TBD|
|Point of Contact (POC)|TBD|
|Expectations|The availability of HeatGrid information enables assessment and analysis of: the impact of construction projects on the local climate; the relationship between building stock and green spaces; and the distribution of surface classes at the municipal level. Through an innovative platform for analysing and visualizing the interaction between current LULC configurations and LST in high resolution, HeatGrid aims to close these existing information gaps. Another added value is the ability to simulate changes in the LULC classes and assess their impact on LST based on IPCC climate scenarios. This tool is intended to facilitate informed decisions for climate adaptation planning and also support sustainable urban and rural development. Stakeholders can use the platform to raise awareness of the impacts of climate change and the importance of sustainable land management, thereby promoting a more informed public discourse on environmental issues.|
|Input Data|Surface temperatures (LST) from various Earth observation sensors: ECOSTRESS: ISS instrument (70m spatial resolution), Landsat 8/9 TIR (100 m thermal sensor Landsat), ASTER (90 m thermal sensor Terra satellite), Sentinel-3 SLSTR (1 km thermal sensor Sentinel-3), Time series of meteorological data (Geosphere): Indicators for demographic, economic, tourism and infrastructural development (Statistik Austria), INCA: Analysis and nowcasting weather data - air temperature, humidity, global radiation and wind speed (hourly resolution, 1 km grid, GeoSphere), Copernicus Land Monitoring Service: high-resolution land cover data, Water and Moisture Index: Presence and extent of water and moisture, Tree Cover Density: Density of tree cover per grid cell from 0 to 100 percent; Degree of sealing: Degree of sealing per grid cell from 0 to 100 percent (GeoVille); Digital elevation model (DEM): Terrain reliefs with precise elevation data and parameters derived from them; Sentinel-2: B02, B03, B04 and B08, including calculation of the NDVI index from the B04 and B08; LULUCF: Land cover and land use typing (10 m resolution, activity for 2023, GeoVille);|
|Pre-processing|A separate preprocessing processor is being developed. This provides the required data in the form of a data cube, consisting of time series and area coverage, for further processing.|
|Run-time|The output results are packaged in containers and made available for installation in the GTIF IT infrastructure. The GTIF capabilities can be demonstrated systematically in a demonstration-like manner via a limited test area via API calls.|
|Output Information Product|TBD|
|GTIF legacy|Snow maps in GTIF-AT Demonstrator|
|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|Comprehensive interactive tool (dashboard/cockpit) for analysing and visualizing the impacts of climate change on tourism planning.|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|Improve urban planning and environmental management through a comprehensive analytical framework focusing on land use/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) at high resolution (10m). Users are enabled to simulate changes in the LULC classes and assess impacts of these simulations based on forward-looking IPCC climate scenarios (data-based decision making for climate adaptation planning).|
|Deviations/ Reservations|None|
|Potential Problems and Identified Solutions|No problems identified yet|
