|Expectations|The capability provides an improved picture of the availability of water in the catchment areas of the reservoirs, especially at the beginning of the snowmelt period in early summer. In the optimized case, there is reliable knowledge of the temporal availability of water, so that it can be stored when there is enough energy from wind and solar power available and water is used to produce energy when other renewable energy sources are limited. In this way, the production of sustainable energy is used in the best possible way while adhering to the framework conditions specified by the authorities, such as refilling a storage lake in the spring by a specified time. The optimized energy production enables CO2 savings.|
|Input Data|Time-series of Copernicus Sentinel satellite data; Time series of meteorological data influencing the snow properties obtained from the ERA-5 reanalysis data. The results of the snow modelling chain made available via the GTIF platform must be pre-processed for their integration with the integrators (Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem APIs) that ensure the interface between the data lake and the platform. The results are converted into a cloud-optimized GEOtiff (COG) format before being transferred to a compatible object storage bucket. After this step, the data is read using the BYOC API (the paths of the files in the object storage are read by the API, which allows the data to be streamed).|
|Pre-processing|Wherever offered and useful, preprocessing and feeding of the input data are implemented by calling OpenEO services.|
|Run-time|Algorithm deployed as container on GTIF/EOxHub and elastic cloud.|
|Output Information Product|Daily Snow Water Equivalent Maps (SWE, 250 m resolution): Representations of the amount of water contained in the snowpack of a given area on a daily basis. SWE refers to the depth of water that would result if the entire snowpack melted immediately. Daily snow depth maps (250 m resolution): Snapshot of the thickness or height of the snow cover over a specific area on a daily basis. These maps show the vertical measurement from the ground surface to the top of the snowpack. Weekly SCA maps (250 m resolution): Overview of the extent of snow cover in a specific area over the course of a week. These maps illustrate the spatial distribution of snowpack by highlighting areas where snow is present and areas where the ground is free of snow. 3-day snowmelt forecast maps (250 m resolution): Predict the amount and spatial distribution of snowmelt in a given area for the next three days.|

|Service outlet, API and/or GUI functions|<p>Two access methods are provided to make the results of the snow modelling chain available to customers. Firstly, programmatic access is provided to transfer the data directly into the workflows of stakeholders. The “Process API” offers programming language-independent access to the results of the snow modelling chain, which are stored in the GTIF data storage and made available via the BYOC API. This means that the user process does not have the entire data archive to integrate the results into its workflow, but can directly access the data in the area and at the time that interests it. This cloud-focused approach enables rapid iteration and rapid prototyping for hydrological integration Models of the actor. In addition, two options will be available for visualization: Access to snow modelling results via the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem's OGC-compliant APIs, which enable streaming the data directly into a GIS environment. Access to data in the Copernicus Browser for visualization of snow modelling results in the browser along with open Copernicus data. Through this interface, the interested party can use all the basic analysis tools available in the Copernicus browser (layer comparison, interactive navigation, measurement tools, etc.).</p><p>The public GTIF-AT portal will therefore display 4 snow variables (snow depth and water content, melt rate, snow-covered area) over Austria between 2017 and 2022.</p>|
|Long-term perspective (governance, sustained operations, funding)|Snow products service, ie. a monitoring service of snow cover properties (extent of snow cover, snow depth, snow water equivalent, snow melt); Information service for short-term and seasonal discharge forecasts to support the applications of water level management in reservoirs, prediction of electricity generation potential, and flood forecasting. The GTIF capabilities should be made technically integrable with the information systems of the users (core processes). In particular, these are: Specialist information systems of the energy supply companies (seasonal runoff forecast for improved storage management), especially that of TIWAG. Flood forecasting systems, especially that of the Tiroler Inn, which is operated jointly by the state of Tyrol and TIWAG. It is intended to develop drafts for subscription plans and license models regarding the availability and scope of services of the GTIF capabilities.|
